The pattern in the total number of transactions over time is an intriguing finding from the dataset analysis that may be discussed with non-technical stakeholders. 

The number of transactions clearly increased during the course of the six-month period from January to June.  
Almost 26,000 transactions were made in January, and the number continued to rise rapidly each month until it reached approximately 35,000 transactions in June. 
This pattern suggests that over time, there has been a rise in demand for the products being offered, which may be the result of a variety of things, 
including rising product popularity, market shifts, or effective marketing efforts.

The data also shows a slight decrease in the volume of transactions in April. 
If there was a specific explanation for the drop in sales that month, such as a holiday or an occasion that may have had an influence on sales, it might be further studied.

Generally, this increase in transaction volume indicates that the company is doing well and expanding.
